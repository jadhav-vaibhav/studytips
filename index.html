        <p class="containandimg">When students sit to study, 'what to study?' 
            It takes a lot of time to decide. It takes time to choose the 
            subject. Don't like English, easy Marathi, don't like geography,
             the subjects are divided in this way. Well, if you choose a subject, 
             it takes time to choose a lesson and till then, TV. A favorite program 
             appears on top. So students should plan their studies. I should record
              what I am going to study tomorrow, what I am going to read in the study
               calendar (Planner) while sleeping tonight. This is called directional study.</p>
